=====================  Compile  =====================

To compile, Run the script: "./build.sh" or use the command "make".

=======================  Run  =======================

To run, the application, Run the script bouncer.sh using the syntax:

"./bouncer.sh <listen_ip <listen_port <server_ip <server_port"

*server_ip: Should be the IP address (name are not supported) of the server where the traffic will be forward by the bouncer.
	    It should respect the format of an IPv4 address (ex: 192.168.0.1)
*server_port:Should be the port of the server where the traffic will be forward by the bouncer.
	    It should respect the format of port number [1..65535]
*listen_ip: The "Fake IP" of the bouncer. The bouncer will only take of traffic send to this IP and drop other traffic.
	    It should respect the format of an IPv4 address (ex: 192.168.0.1), name are not supported
*listen_port: The listen port of the bouncer.  For TCP, The bouncer will only take of traffic send to this port and drop other traffic.
	    For ICMP traffic this port will be ignored.
	    It should respect the format of port number [1..65535]

====================== IP addressing issues ========

In order to be able to reach the "Fake IP" of the bouncer, you need to add some static route.
